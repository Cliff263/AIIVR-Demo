I understand the requirements for the AIIVR system. Let me break down the key components we'll need to implement:

1. **Call Management System**
   - Call logs with detailed entries
   - Recording playback functionality
   - Immutable recording storage
   - Call status tracking

2. **Dashboard System**
   - Separate views for Agents and Supervisors
   - Real-time KPI monitoring
   - Queue status management
   - Analytics integration

3. **Agent Status Management**
   - Dynamic pause/play functionality
   - Status options with queue management
   - Supervisor override capabilities

4. **Permission System**
   - Role-based access control
   - Supervisor privileges
   - Agent limitations

5. **Query Management**
   - Query tracking
   - Assignment system
   - Status monitoring

Before implementing, we should consider:
1. Database schema for:
   - Call logs
   - Recordings
   - User roles
   - Queries
   - Status tracking

2. API endpoints for:
   - Call management
   - Status updates
   - Recording access
   - Analytics

3. UI Components needed:
   - Call log table
   - Status controls
   - Dashboard widgets
   - Query management interface

some clues for implementing:
ðŸŽ¯ Agent Dashboard Design

1. Call Logs & Recordings
- Consolidated Call Log: Display all inbound, outbound, and missed calls with filters for date, time, and call type.
- Interactive Entries: Clicking on a call reveals detailed information:
  - Timestamp, duration, and caller ID.
  - Access to call recordings with playback functionality.
- Immutable Recordings: Ensure recordings are stored securely and cannot be deleted or modified by agents, maintaining compliance and integrity.

2. Real-Time Status Monitoring
- Dynamic Status Indicator: Clearly display the agent's current status (e.g., Online, On Call, Paused) with color-coded indicators.
- Pause/Play Toggle: Allow agents to toggle their availability with predefined reasons:
  - Lunch, Bathroom, Smoke, On Leave, Case Work.
- Auto Queue Management: Automatically adjust call routing based on the agent's status to ensure efficient call distribution.

3. Performance Metrics
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
  - Number of calls handled.
  - Average handling time.
  - First call resolution rate.
  - Customer satisfaction scores.
- Visual Representation: Use graphs and charts for intuitive understanding of performance trends.

4. Query Management
- Assigned Queries: List of open and assigned queries with statuses.
- Actionable Items: Options to update, escalate, or close queries directly from the dashboard.

ðŸ§­ Supervisor Dashboard Design

1. Team Overview
- Agent Status Panel: Real-time view of all agents' statuses, including availability and current call engagement.
- Performance Summaries: Aggregate metrics such as total calls handled, average handling time, and team CSAT scores.

2. Call Monitoring & Intervention
- Live Call Monitoring: Listen in on ongoing calls for quality assurance.
- Whisper Coaching: Provide real-time guidance to agents without the caller's knowledge.
- Barge-In Capability: Join calls when necessary to assist or take over.

3. Queue Management
- Real-Time Queue Stats: Monitor call volumes, wait times, and abandonment rates.
- Agent Allocation: Redistribute agents to different queues based on demand.

4. Agent Status Control
- Override Functionality: Ability to change an agent's status, especially if they exceed allowed pause durations.
- Notifications: Alerts for prolonged agent inactivity or other anomalies.

5. Advanced Analytics
- Historical Data Access: Review past performance metrics for trend analysis.
- Custom Reports: Generate reports based on specific parameters or timeframes.
- Integration with External Tools: Link to detailed analytics platforms for in-depth analysis.
