I understand the requirements for the AIIVR system. Let me break down the key components we'll need to implement:

1. **Call Management System**
   - Call logs with detailed entries
   - Recording playback functionality
   - Immutable recording storage
   - Call status tracking

2. **Dashboard System**
   - Separate views for Agents and Supervisors
   - Real-time KPI monitoring
   - Queue status management
   - Analytics integration

3. **Agent Status Management**
   - Dynamic pause/play functionality
   - Status options with queue management
   - Supervisor override capabilities

4. **Permission System**
   - Role-based access control
   - Supervisor privileges
   - Agent limitations

5. **Query Management**
   - Query tracking
   - Assignment system
   - Status monitoring

Before implementing, we should consider:
1. Database schema for:
   - Call logs
   - Recordings
   - User roles
   - Queries
   - Status tracking

2. API endpoints for:
   - Call management
   - Status updates
   - Recording access
   - Analytics

3. UI Components needed:
   - Call log table
   - Status controls
   - Dashboard widgets
   - Query management interface

Would you like me to start implementing any specific part of this system? I can begin with:
1. Setting up the database schema
2. Creating the basic UI components
3. Implementing the authentication and role system
4. Building the call log interface

Please let me know which aspect you'd like to tackle first.
